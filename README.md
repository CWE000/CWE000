## 🛠️  Technical Skills & Milestones:
- ✅ Installed VirtualBox
- ✅ Installed Ubuntu Server (VirtualBox VM)
- ✅ Installed Kali Linux (VirtualBox VM)
- ✅ Installed Windows 11 (VirtualBox VM)
- ✅ Updated Ubuntu Server (UFW Firewall & SSH)
- ✅ Configured a private virtual network for the lab (VirtualBox NAT Network)
- ✅ Installed and configured the full Wazuh SIEM platform
- ✅ Deployed a Wazuh agent on a remote Kali Linux workstation
- ✅ Deployed a Wazuh agent on a remote Windows 11 workstation
- ✅ Explored File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** by detecting real-time file changes
- ✅ Investigated and remediated system vulnerabilities using Wazuh
- ✅ Simulate basic attacks (failed logins, port scans) and analyze the alerts in Wazuh.
- ✅ Generate and Analyze the First Real Alerts.
- ✅ Configured and utilized the Wazuh **Vulnerability Detector** module to proactively find CVEs.
